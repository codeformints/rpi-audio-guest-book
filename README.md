This is a project I created a little while ago for a wedding to record messages from guests.

It was made for a raspberry pi wired to an old dial phone. 
The way it works is that you lift the phone off the hook, it plays a pre-recorded message on the phone speaker and then starts recording audio from the phones microphone.

This is a project I created a little while ago in python 3.10 for a wedding to record messages from guests.

It was made for a raspberry pi wired to an old dial phone. 
The way it works is that you lift the phone off the hook, it plays a pre-recorded message on the phone speaker and then starts recording audio from the phones microphone.

The hook should be wired to pin 16 on the raspberry pi, although that can be easily changed.

The dial isn't really used.

Some folders will need pre-prepared:
Place a pre-record.wav in a folder named intro-msg next to python script.
Files will be recorded as .wav into a folder named audio next to the python script.
